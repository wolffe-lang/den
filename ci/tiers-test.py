"""ci/tiers-test.py — the planner's own proof (wolf-lang's tl21 test, as
lope cut it, cut again to den's workflow). python3 only.

  T1  the tiers by event: a trunk push, the nightly, a dispatch with no
      jobs and the `full-matrix` label are full; another label's
      `labeled` event is a noop; a dispatch naming jobs is partial, and
      refuses a job the workflow does not have.
  T2  the pull-request tiers by path: code is pr (linux, plan-test);
      prose alone is noop; prose beside code is pr.
  T3  full wins: a path no rule names; changed paths that cannot be read.
  T4  the wiring of .github/workflows/ci.yml: every job but `plan` needs
      it and runs only when the plan names it; `tier` needs every job,
      runs on `!cancelled()` and calls the verdict; cancel-in-progress is
      for pull requests only; the trunk push, the nightly, the label and
      the dispatch input are there; macos is no pull-request job.
  T6  the verdict: green for a full, a pr, a noop and a partial run; red
      for a chosen job failed or skipped, a job that ran unasked, a failed
      plan, a plan with no tier, a full that chose less.
  T8  ci/nightly-red.sh against a stand-in `gh` (boreutils' T8): no open
      issue opens one; an open one is commented on; a label that exists is
      no failure; the script refuses without its environment; the
      nightly-red job runs on a failed schedule only, after the verdict.

Exit 0 when every check passes, 1 otherwise.
